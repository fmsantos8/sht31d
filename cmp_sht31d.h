 * Supply dependencies and context storage through sht31_config.h.
 *
 * The board must provide stable power and a completed power-up/reset. This
 * component exclusively owns the sensor in single-shot mode from its idle
 * power-up state; taking over an externally configured periodic acquisition
 * requires stopping/resetting that acquisition first. Before reinitializing a
 * live sensor, allow any previous conversion to finish. init() does not reset
 * the sensor, construct the I2C bus, or reserve dynamic/arena storage.
 *
 * All calls must be serialized in normal execution context, including access to
 * the shared I2C bus. No ISR support, synchronization, scheduler, or delay is
 * provided. Transfers are synchronous and use the bus's configured timeout;
 * this does not guarantee a strict deadline for the whole call. The context and
 * borrowed bus must outlive their uses. Do not modify context fields or overlap
 * it with arguments/outputs. Other calls require a context previously passed to
 * init(), or a zero-initialized context which returns NOT_INITIALIZED.
 *
 * @param[out] sensor Required caller-owned context.
 * @param[in] config Required bus handle and unshifted address.
 * @return OK, INVALID_ARGUMENT, NOT_INITIALIZED, NOT_SUPPORTED, TIMEOUT, or
 * COMMUNICATION_ERROR, according to validation and the I2C result.

 * before read_measurement(). The caller measures that elapsed time and can do
 * other work in between. The component never reads the clock or starts a timer.
 *
 * A second start before reading returns INVALID_STATE without I2C traffic. A
 * failed start leaves no pending read, but the command may have reached the

 * attempted, the pending measurement is consumed, including on I2C or CRC
 * failure: start a fresh measurement for the next acquisition. Argument or
